This chrome extension was originally from [**this repository**](https://github.com/shevabam/get-rss-feed-url-extension). And most of the code for finding the RSS feed is from that project.
This project is simply a fork of it that allows you to be redirected right to your freshrss instance to add a feed easily.


# Install

Currently it is not on the chrome web store, but you can download the whole repository and import it into chrome with developer mode on.  See [**this site**](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) on how to do that.
